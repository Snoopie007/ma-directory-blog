The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC )was born in 1993, but it wasn't until 2001 – when Dana White became the president –  that the fighting league became popular. Boxing used to be the top combat sport, but these days, UFC reigns supreme, and Jon Jones' triumphant return to the octagon brought plenty of hype. There have been a plethora of great UFC fighters to come and go from every weight class. We have seen this organization grow from a wild experience into one of the most recognized sports leagues in the world.

## 1. Jon "Bones" Jones (27-1 1 NC)

Jones was a dominant fighter. He enjoyed a meteoric rise as the UFC's light heavyweight champion, winning 11 title defenses. Throughout his career, he's beaten the likes of Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Rashad Evans, Daniel Cormier, and Vitor Belfort. The best light heavyweight of all time, his only loss was by disqualification because of throwing illegal elbows. While his off-field issues have been highly publicized, he's still one of the greats. 

In recent news, Jones jumped to the heavyweight division and beat Cyril Gane for the vacant championship belt. Becoming a two-division champion caused Jones' legacy to skyrocket to GOAT status. 

## 2. George St-Pierre (26-2)

George St-Pierre is the greatest MMA fighter of all time. He learned karate after being bullied by kids at elementary school. From this suffering, he found his calling. The rest is history. St-Pierre's run as the welterweight champion of the UFC was legendary. In his prime, St-Pierre went on a 13-fight winning streak along with nine consecutive title defenses. St-Pierre has recorded the most takedowns in UFC history. 

After vacating the welterweight title and leaving the octagon for four years, St-Pierre beat Michael Bisping for the middleweight title. He became just the fourth fighter in UFC history to become a two-division champion. After the fact, he vacated the middleweight title because of ulcerative colitis. St-Pierre is the rare fighter who walked away at the top.  

 
## 3. Anderson Silva (34-11 1 NC)

The greatest striker of all time, Silva was unstoppable in his prime. He spent 2,457 days as middleweight champion, the longest title reign in UFC history. This record may never be broken. The Brazilian brawler won 16 fights in a row and defended his middleweight championship 10 times. After breaking his fibula and tibia, Silva was never the same. Despite ending his career with a 1-5 record, it didn't tarnish Silva's legacy. His championship bout with Chael Sonnen in UFC 117 exemplifies his resiliency and will to win. 

 
## 4. Demetrious "Mighty Mouse" Johnson (27-3-1)

Don't let his size fool you (5-foot-3, 125 pounds), Johnson is one of the GOATs. A great wrestler, his lightning-fast takedowns and ground-and-pound style devastated his opponents. Johnson was the UFC's first flyweight champion. He didn't look back, defending his title 11 times. Clearly the best flyweight in UFC history, he was dethroned in 2018. Now, he fights in ONE Championship, an MMA promotion based in Singapore. 

## 5. Conor "The Notorious" McGregor (22-6)

The Notorious himself. The biggest pay-per-view (PPV) draw in UFC history, McGregor won over fans with his legendary trash-talking and aggressive fighting style. McGregor popularized the sport and helped turn it into what it is today. The Irish brawler became the first simultaneous two-division champion, holding the featherweight and lightweight belts. A southpaw, McGregor's accuracy with his punches made him a knockout threat and a fun fighter to watch. He even boxed Floyd Mayweather in 2017. He was the highest-paid athlete in the world in 2021. 

Imitated by many but never surpassed, his impact on the sport is undeniable.
