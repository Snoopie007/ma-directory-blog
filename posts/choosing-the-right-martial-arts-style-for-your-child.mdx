Martial arts can be a positive, healthy activity for your kids—if they're involved in a discipline that matches their interests and personality. But with a dizzying array of martial arts options, it can be tough to pick the right one.

Each discipline requires slightly different skills and techniques in order to be successful. Depending on the child, he or she will likely prefer one over the others. Finding the right match begins by understanding each discipline and philosophy.

Philosophical teachings focus on leading a happy and balanced life, with activity being a primary area of concentration. Breaking boards and forms are a major elements used during training.

## Tae Kwon Do

Tae Kwon Do is one of the most popular of all the martial arts and is even an Olympic sport. Attacks involve kicks, punches and throws, making it a well-rounded option.

Who it's for: If you child doesn't do well in close personal spaces or has slow reflexes, this probably isn't the martial art you should choose. It also relies more on upper body movement, which is good if your child struggles with kicks. If you want a sport that focuses on balance and concentration, this is a good pick.

## Judo

Also an Olympic sport, Judo was designed to defend against strikes and use the opponents attacking mentality against them. Concentration is on throws that involve timing and controlling your opponent's body weight.

Who it's for: If your child wants a martial art that involves striking, this isn't the discipline. If learning throws and defense are a high priority, judo is one of the best there is.
